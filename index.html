      <p> Pets Run a better place in <span class="important"> MY HEART</span>! wooow am so emotional right now knowing I once lost a pet because I trusted someone can take care of it</p>
      <p>My pets are my family and I have a special place in my heart for each one of them. As our pets get older and sometimes develop illnesses, we are reluctant to leave them. We want to always stick around and watch them.</p>
      <div class="test-box">Am not sure if you are feeling me; we just want to <span class="cat-climate">be arond them</span>,<span class="cat-climate">feed them</span> or <span class="cat-climate">just make them feel special</span>. Has someone who
        makes you happy gone dull for just an hour?<span class="important"> God</span>! It always feels like forever, you just want them to get back to normal. I am committed to providing you not only the the reassurance, but the confidence that
        you need, to feel comfortable leaving your pet.</div>
      <p>I run Happy Pets on a simple philosophy, whatever your pet needs, I will take care of it while you are gone because I want the same for my pets.</p>
